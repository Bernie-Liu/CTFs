Bad Apple! A classic example used as a proof of concept to demonstrate the ability to display a sequence of black-and-white images in virtually any medium---oscilloscopes, mechanical flip dots, electronic billboards, or this CTF challenge.

Bad Apple, on the other hand, is often used to prove that anything capable of rendering black and white can play a video.
